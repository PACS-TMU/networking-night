# Tech Networking Night - PACS x USSTM
We are excited to announce our Tech Networking Night (in collaboration with USSTM) happening on March 21st, 2024. This repository houses the webpage that contains all the details of this event, hosted on [networking.usstm.ca](https://networking.usstm.ca).

## Structure of Website
This website was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which is a great tool to build static websites/webpages. Moreover, this project utilizes tailwind CSS, as well as regular CSS to create the design.

To run the project on localhost, clone this repository and run the following commands:
```
npm i
```
Followed by:
```
npm run dev
```
Visit [your localhost](http://localhost:3000) to see the page being run.

## RSVP
The RSVP form on the webpage leads to the same google sheet as the google form sign up form. This allows easy tracking of the sign-ups in a safe and secure manner.
